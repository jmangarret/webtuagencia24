<h2>Joom!Fish - be in control of your localization</h2>
<div id="introduction">
<p>
	The Joom!Fish extensions provides you the capabilities to manage, control and maintain your different language versions of your website that go beyond the core Joomla features.<br />
	The purpose of this extension is a translation management for all content stored in any extension you use with Joomla.
	To achieve this you need to follow 4 basic steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Define the languages in which you like to allow your users to view your website using the <a href="<?php echo JURI::root(); ?>administrator/index.php?option=com_joomfish&task=languages.show">content language manager</a>.</li>
	<li>Configure the <a href="<?php echo JURI::root(); ?>administrator/index.php?option=com_modules&filter_search=JoomFish">JoomFish language selector</a> and the <a href="<?php echo JURI::root(); ?>administrator/index.php?option=com_plugins&view=plugins&filter_search=JoomFish">JoomFish specific router plugin</a> in the way you like your website to behave.</li>
	<li>To translate your information such as menus or articles please use the <a href="<?php echo JURI::root(); ?>administrator/index.php?option=com_joomfish&task=translate.overview">translation overview</a>.<br />After you created the translated (linked) item once you can edit them within the Joomla system directly. Don't forget to publish your translations ;-).</li>
	<li>Add additional translation maps (content elements) to allow the translation of additional information such as your shop, calendar and many more.</li>
</ol>

	<p>Managing website content is made really easy using Joomla! CMS. Adding an other language however can increase the complexity quite a lot.<br />
	We highly recommend that you plan your website structure in one language first before you start translating the information. Also plan the translation as
	sometimes you will encounter strange behavior of your site if you changed something in your original but did not updated the translation accordingly.</p>

		for you. You will find a lot of information related multilingual websites, localization and more.</p>
